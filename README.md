# Reframe360 XL

This plugin is an extension of the excellent Reframe360 (http://reframe360.com/) plugin by Stefan Sietzen.  When Stefan discontinued the project and released the source code, I got to work to add features and fix bugs and it became Reframe360 XL.  XL is used to point out that new features were put in place and is also a nudge to the excellent SkaterXL game.

New features and bug fixes:
- New animmation curves implemented (Sine, Expo, Circular)
- Apply animation curves to main camera parameters
- Fix black dot in center of output
- Update to latest libraries and Resolve 17

Enjoy!
